## Changelog

We try to log all changes big and small in both [THE CHANGELOG](https://github.com/lando/laravel/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and the [release notes](https://github.com/lando/laravel/releases).


## Development

* Requires [Node 14+](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/)
* Prefers [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lando/laravel.git && cd laravel
yarn install
```

If you dont' want to install Node 14 or Yarn for whatever reason you can install [Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html) and use that:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lando/laravel.git && cd laravel
# Install deps and get node
lando start

# Run commands
lando node
lando yarn
```

## Testing

```bash
# Lint the code
yarn lint

# Run unit tests
yarn test
```

## Releasing

```bash
yarn release
```
