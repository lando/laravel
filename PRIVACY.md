The Software automatically communicates with Lando Alliance to send error reports and collect usage data so we may improve the Software and fix critical bugs.

We use your data to provide and improve the Software. By using the Software, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lando/lando/master/TERMS.md

### Usage Data

Usage Data is data collected automatically by the use of the Software.

### Crash Data

Crash Data is data collected automatically by the use of the Software when it crashes or errors.

### Data Controller

Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information are, or are to be, processed.

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data.

### Data Processors (or Software Providers)

## Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Software to you.

### Types of Data Collected

#### Usage Data

Usage data does not contain any Personal Data such as an IP Address or Email. However, each Lando instance is associated with an identification key. The Data Subject themselves is the only person who would be able to use this identification key to identify relevant Usage Data as theirs.

You may opt out of sending the usage data and error reports by following instructions provided in relevant Software documentation.

#### Crash Data

Crash Data will only be sent to Lando Alliance if the user opts in and gives us permission to do so. We have tried our best to pseudonymize Crash Data, but recognize that some path names and other information that we collect may inadvertently include Personal Data, including but not limited to usernames and site names.
